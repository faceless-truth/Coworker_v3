"""Mail routes: read endpoints over the signed-in user's mailbox.

Day-one surface is one route: ``GET /api/v1/inbox`` returns the
user's most recent 25 messages. Phase 6 will fan this out into the
inbox list page in the React frontend; for now it's a smoke endpoint
so a real principal can sign in via the OAuth flow and immediately
see their own inbox come through the v3 stack end-to-end.

The route is intentionally thin: ``current_user`` and ``graph_context``
do all the heavy lifting (auth, firm scope, token refresh). The
handler just calls ``list_inbox`` and returns the result. Any future
filter/sort/paginate parameters belong in ``list_inbox`` so the rest
of the orchestrator can use them too.
