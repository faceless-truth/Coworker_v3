"""FastAPI dependencies that resolve the authenticated caller.

`current_user` reads the `coworker_session` JWT cookie issued by the
OAuth callback, decodes it, and looks the user up under
`firm_context(firm_id)` so the SELECT is RLS-scoped to the JWT's
claimed firm. Every failure path returns the same generic 401 — same
status, same body — so the response does not distinguish "no cookie"
from "expired token" from "forged signature" from "unknown user".
An attacker probing the endpoint cannot tell which condition fired.

Cross-firm resistance falls out of RLS. A forged JWT that flips the
`firm_id` claim (which would require the signing secret) and pairs it
with a `sub` that belongs to a different firm still won't return a
user row: the SELECT runs under `firm_context(claimed_firm_id)` and
RLS filters out users in any other firm. The lookup yields None and
the dependency raises 401. So even with a leaked secret, an attacker
cannot impersonate a user in a firm they don't already belong to —
they can only impersonate a user inside the firm whose identity their
forgery already implies.

The `firm_context` block exits before the dependency returns. The
firm scope is re-established later by downstream dependencies
(notably `graph_context`) for the duration of their own DB work.
Holding it across the whole request would over-scope it to code paths
that legitimately don't need it.
