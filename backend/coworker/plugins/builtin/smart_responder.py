"""SmartResponderPlugin — first builtin plugin.

Triggered by ``email_received`` events from Phase 11's Graph
webhook receiver. The agent loop reads the triggering email,
queries firm memory for context (similar past interactions,
lessons, relevant documents), looks up the sender in the KG,
and produces a draft reply via the ``email_create_draft`` tool.

In shadow mode (firm.shadow_mode=True), the create_draft tool
is gated by ``guard_writable`` at the connector layer and no
draft is actually created — the would-be content lands in the
audit log and Phase 9's approval queue instead. Outside shadow
mode, the draft is created in the user's Drafts folder; Phase 9
gates whether the draft gets queued for approval before sending.

Tool category set (read-only + write):

- memory: ground the response in past interactions / lessons /
  documents.
- kg: identify the sender's entity, walk relationships.
- email: read the triggering message + create the draft reply.
- reasoning: today's date + firm info.

Cost budget defaults to $0.20 per run — enough for ~6-8 Sonnet
iterations including a memory_query + several tool calls. Firms
that want a deeper draft can raise via plugin_installations.config
(``cost_budget_cents`` override) once that knob is wired in
Phase 6.

Config (``SmartResponderConfig``):

- ``confidence_threshold``: minimum self-consistency confidence
  (Phase 9) for auto-execution of the draft. Below this the
  draft routes to approval. Defaults to 0.85; the Phase 9
  approval queue is what reads this.
- ``style_hint``: free-text override for the system prompt's
  voice instructions. Useful when a firm prefers a particular
  tone ("formal", "warm", "concise").
