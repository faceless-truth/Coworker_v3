"""``AgentContext`` — the per-run bundle every tool handler sees.

Construct once at the top of ``OrchestratorEngine.run()`` and pass
it through every tool invocation. Tools deconstruct the fields
they need (session, firm, anthropic, retriever, embedder, …);
adding new dependencies requires updating this class so the
boundary stays explicit.

    Frozen so a handler can't accidentally mutate ``firm`` or swap
    out the session under another handler. ``metadata`` is an
    escape hatch for plugin-specific extras (Phase 6) — the
    engine never reads it, so plugins can stash anything that
    survives the run.

    - ``budget_cents`` is the maximum the run may spend on Claude
      calls. ``None`` means no cap.
    - The engine maintains running totals on the trace row; the
      handler can inspect ``budget_cents`` to decide whether to
      decline an expensive sub-call (e.g. specialist consult).
