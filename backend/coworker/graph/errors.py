"""Shared Microsoft Graph response handling.

Every Graph endpoint module (``mail``, ``calendar``, soon ``drive``
and ``profile``) maps the same handful of HTTP outcomes to the same
``ConnectorError`` subclasses and writes the same shape of failure
audit row. Centralising that logic here keeps the mapping identical
across endpoints and makes the audit chain consistent for anyone
querying ``WHERE action LIKE 'graph.%_failed'``.

Three callables make up the surface:

- ``raise_for_graph_status`` — inspect an ``httpx.Response``, return
  on 2xx, audit and raise the appropriate ``ConnectorError`` for
  every non-2xx status code.
- ``audit_failure`` — append a ``<action>_failed`` audit row with a
  standard payload and commit. Network-error paths use this directly
  because there's no response to inspect.
- ``parse_retry_after`` — parse Graph's integer-seconds Retry-After
  header, returning None for missing or non-numeric values.

The status→exception mapping is Graph-specific (Microsoft's status
codes and headers); Anthropic / XPM / FuseSign translate from their
own SDKs to the shared ``ConnectorError`` family in their own
connector modules.

    Returns silently on 2xx. Every non-2xx code emits a

    Args:
        response: the Graph response to inspect.
        session: caller's AsyncSession; the failure audit row commits
            on it before raising so the row survives any subsequent
            rollback when FastAPI propagates the exception.
        firm_id, user_id: identifiers stamped on the audit row. For
            ``actor_type="system"`` (background workflows with no
            signed-in user), ``user_id`` carries a synthetic actor
            string such as ``"system"``.
        action: dotted action name, e.g. ``graph.mail.get_message``.
            ``_failed`` is appended for the audit action.
        allow_not_found: True for fetch-by-id endpoints where 404 is a
            real "the thing was deleted" condition (raises
            ``ConnectorNotFound``); False for list endpoints where
            404 shouldn't happen and would be a misconfigured caller
            (treated as auth-class for safety).
        extra: optional dict merged into the audit row's payload —
            typically the id of the resource being fetched.
        actor_type: ``"user"`` (default) for delegated-token calls;
            ``"system"`` for app-only / background workflows
            (subscription renewal, SharePoint indexer).

    Raises:
        ConnectorNotFound: 404 and ``allow_not_found=True``.
        ConnectorAuthError: 401, 403, or any other unhandled 4xx
            (including 404 when ``allow_not_found=False``).
        ConnectorRateLimited: 429. ``retry_after`` parsed from the
            Retry-After header when numeric.
        ConnectorTransient: 5xx.
