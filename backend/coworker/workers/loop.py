"""BRPOP worker loop — long-running consumer of the plugin event queue.

A single process can run one or more concurrent ``run_worker``
tasks; multiple workers BRPOP'ing the same Redis list is safe
because Redis hands each event to exactly one consumer. The
loop:

1. Blocks on ``queue.dequeue(timeout_seconds=idle_poll_seconds)``
   so the stop signal is honoured within a bounded delay.
2. Hands each dequeued event to ``process_event``.
3. Catches and logs any exception so the loop never dies on a
   bad event — the next iteration BRPOPs the next one.

Shutdown is cooperative via an ``asyncio.Event``. The supervising
script wires SIGINT/SIGTERM to ``stop_event.set()`` before
awaiting the worker tasks.
