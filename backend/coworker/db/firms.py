"""Firm-row lookups that must read across firm boundaries.

The slug-keyed lookup pattern shows up wherever we know a firm's slug
but not its id — bootstrap-firm, the OAuth start route, future admin
tooling. Under FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY on `firms`, a SELECT cannot
match across firms with `app.firm_id` unset, and we *can't* set it to
a useful value because the whole point of the lookup is to discover
which firm the slug belongs to.

This module wraps the necessary `ALTER TABLE firms NO FORCE / SELECT
/ ALTER TABLE firms FORCE` bracket so callers don't reproduce the
pattern. The `coworker` role owns `firms` so it can ALTER TABLE; FORCE
is restored within the same transaction so on commit the table state
is unchanged. Same shape as `_seed_two_firms` in test_rls.py.

Callers that want to write firm-scoped data after the lookup should
commit (releasing this transaction's NO FORCE/FORCE bracket), then
enter `firm_context(firm.id)` for the write. Doing the write under
the still-open NO FORCE-bracket transaction would also work but
defeats RLS for the duration of the transaction — preferring a
commit-and-re-enter pattern keeps RLS enforcement narrow.
